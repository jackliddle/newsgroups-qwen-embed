Jim Brown obviously has possession of the right-wing token. \"In December, former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told a Senate committee that sanctions were costing Iraq $100 million per day, and that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world. Iraq, he suggested, was losing badly every day it defied the UN demands, while the community of nations won every day -- with no taking of life or loss of life.\" -- FCNL Washington Newsletter. Wrongful actions of murderers like leaders of the US government, perhaps? Regrettable, of course; The-Way-It-Is - certainly not. Good heavens! An escapee from Rush Limbot Land! \"Conservative\", my ass. BULLSHIT!!! In the Gulf Massacre, 7% of all ordnance used was \"smart.\" The rest - that's 93% - was just regular, dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. Have you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage? Or that a successful interception of a Scud was defined as \"the Patriot and Scud passed each other in the same area of the sky\"? And of the 7% that was the \"smart\" stuff, 35% hit. Again - try to follow me here - that means 65% of this \"smart\" arsenal missed. Prove it. I have a source that says that to date, the civilian death count (er, excuse me, I mean \"collateral damage\") is about 200,000. -s -- \"No one has attempted to calculate the costs of an execution in Washington state, but studies elsewhere suggest it costs far more than incarceration. \"California is spending more than $90 million annually on capital cases, and until this year hadn't executed anyone since 1972. Texas, the national leader in the number of executions, spends an estimated $2.3 million per execution. That compares to an average cost of incarceration in Washington state of $25,000 per maximum-security prisoner per year.\"",

And \"given by god\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something. Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man. (Deletion) The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system. (Deletion) Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book. (Big deletion) No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used. It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well? (Deletion) Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system. (Deletion) If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has to be done by god? And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.",

Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world. There are no Islamic banks in \"the West\", including the USA, to my knowledge. I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not while \"Islamic banks\" are at a relatively early stage of their development as is the case now. BCCI is most certainly not an \"Islamic bank\" -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits? If the answer to this question is \"yes\", then BCCI was not an Islamic bank, as Islamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.

    "text": "This kind of argument cries for a comment... : >>...God did not create : >>disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns. : > : >>What God did create was life according to a protein code which is : >>mutable and can evolve. Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw. : > ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~ Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we? Perhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains. Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences. I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters. : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own. It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different. Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion. : I think you misread my meaning. I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesn't mean it's perfect now. It has certainly evolved since. For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence. In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) : Perhaps. I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage. In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. : Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life. According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created. It would still be too primitive to support life. I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth. Anyone with a better estimate? I'd replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve. I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic. Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this. Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed \"degeneration\"?

    "text": "Archive-name: atheism/introduction Alt-atheism-archive-name: introduction Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.2 -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- An Introduction to Atheism by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk> This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism. Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint. I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article. To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist. All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created. Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article. Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint. This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism. So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being. Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not. \"What is atheism?\" Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist. The former is often referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong atheism\". It is important to note the difference between these two positions. \"Weak atheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God. \"Strong atheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist. Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\". Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials. \"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\" Definitely not. Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true. Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not. Which brings us to agnosticism. \"What is agnosticism then?\" The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876. He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable. Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists. Words are slippery things, and language is inexact. Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic. For example, many people use agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when referring to \"strong atheism\". Beware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists. About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God. For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe. \"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\" There are many philosophical justifications for atheism. To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her. Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist. Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists. \"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\" There are many counter-examples to such a statement. For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers. Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules. Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate. However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God. If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example. If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there. Such an exhaustive search is often impractic",

And there is no \"alternative\", but the point }is, \"rationality\" isn't an alternative either. The problems of metaphysical }and religious knowledge are unsolvable-- or I should say, humans cannot }solve them. If there is truly no alternative, then you have no basis whatsoever for your claim. The usual line here, which you call \"a prejudgment of atheism\", and dispute, is that reason is all we have. Here you admit that you have no alternative, no possible basis for the claim that there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in religious knowledge, except possibly that reason conflicts with \"religious knowledge\". This sounds very much like \"I can't provide a rational defense for my belief, but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it may be false\". I hope it makes you happy, but your repeated and unfounded assertions to this effect don't advance your cause.",

    "text": ": I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of : the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group : of the population. I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority. Could it be possible that many people believe in god \"just in case\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how. People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \"born in the Spirit\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about. I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless - a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) ) : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking. The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively. But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness. If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do. However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics. Is usefulness any criterion? Petri",

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups. Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net. In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again. In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles: 1. Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers 2. Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism 3. Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 4. Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument 5. Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources This is article number 1. Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting. The others are entirely optional. If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers. The articles titled \"A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community\", \"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\" and \"Hints on writing style for Usenet\" are particularly relevant. Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions. If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the \"Finding Stuff\" section below. Credits These files could not have been written without the assistance of the many readers of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated. In particular, I'd like to thank the following people: kck+@cs.cmu.edu (Karl Kluge) perry@dsinc.com (Jim Perry) NETOPRWA@ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu (Wayne Aiken) chpetk@gdr.bath.ac.uk (Toby Kelsey) jkp@cs.HUT.FI (Jyrki Kuoppala) geoff.arnold@East.Sun.COM (Geoff Arnold) torkel@sics.se (Torkel Franzen) kmldorf@utdallas.edu (George Kimeldorf) roe2@quads.uchicago.edu (Greg Roelofs) arromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu (Ken Arromdee) madhaus@netcom.com (Maddi Hausmann) J5J@psuvm.psu.edu (John A.

These articles are free. Truly free. You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish. However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network. Finding Stuff All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system. Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them: 1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism. Look for subject lines starting with \"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\". 2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines. If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the problem. 3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226]. Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest versions of the FAQ files there. FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers. If you need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the body. 4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings. The article \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers. 5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu consisting of the following lines: send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources send usenet/alt.atheism/faq send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction send usenet/alt.atheism/logic send usenet/alt.atheism/resources 5. (Penultimate resort) Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of the following lines: send atheism/faq/faq.txt send atheism/faq/logic.txt send atheism/faq/intro.txt send atheism/faq/resource.txt and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files. There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and \"send atheism/index\". 6. (Last resort) Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files. You should only do this if you've tried the a",

Of course, people would have to come up with more fascinating rationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch... It seems to me, that for most people, religion in America doesn't matter that much.

Gillow, noted geneticist, has revealed some unusual data after working undercover in the Vatican for the past 18 years. \"The Popehat(tm) is actually an advanced bone spur.\", reveals Gillow in his groundshaking report. Gillow, who had secretly studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair, first approached the scientific community with his theory in the late 1950's. \"The whole hat thing, that was just a cover up. The Vatican didn't want the Catholic Community(tm) to realize their leader was hefting nearly 8 kilograms of extraneous bone tissue on the top of his skull.\", notes Gillow in his report. \"There are whole laboratories in the Vatican that experiment with tissue transplants and bone marrow experiments. What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400's is now scientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant idea started in the mid sixties inspired by doctor Timothy Leary transplanting deer bone cells into small white rats.\" Gillow is quick to point out the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr. Leary from the public eye. \"When it becomes time to replace the pope\", says Gillow, \"The old pope and the replacement pope are locked in a padded chamber. They butt heads much like male yaks fighting for dominance of the herd. The victor emerges and has earned the privilege of inseminating the choir boys.\" P.",

If it does (and it may for some people I suppose) it certainly isn't as big a leap of faith to say that these things (and god) DO exist.

However, trying to force a psychological fantasy (I don't mean that in a bad way, but that's what it really is) on someone else who isn't interested is extremely rude. What if I still believed in Santa Claus and said that my belief in Santa did wonderful things for my life (making me a better person, allowing me to live without guilt, etc...) and then tried to get you to believe in Santa too just 'cuz he did so much for me?

    "text": "FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY by Robert E. McElwaine, Physicist Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody \"knew\" that a heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly. It would violate the \"laws\" of physics. All of the \"experts\" and \"authorities\" said so. For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901: \"The demonstration that no possible combination of known substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of force, can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be.\" Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final word. Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they crash). Today, orthodox physicists and other \"scientists\" are saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy' Technologies, using negative terms such as \"pseudo-science\" and \"perpetual motion\", and citing so-called \"laws\" which assert that \"energy cannot be created or destroyed\" (\"1st law of thermodynamics\") and \"there is always a decrease in useful energy\" (\"2nd law of thermodynamics\"). The physicists do not know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare that those things cannot be done. Such PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern \"science\" and help to cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox modern theories. Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with- OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by various forms of induction. UNLIKE solar or wind devices, they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed. Solar energy has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and high latitudes. Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and often non-existent. Neither solar nor wind power are suitable to directly power cars and airplanes. Properly designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic field. The first two require a feedback network in order to be self-running. The third one, as described in detail in \"Science & Mechanics\" magazine, Spring 1980, (\"Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor\", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback. Such a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible heatpump in one's home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE. [Complete descriptive copies of U.S. patents are $3.00 each from the U.S. Patent Office, 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202; correct 7-digit patent number required. Or try getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your local public or university library's inter-library loan dept..] A second type of free-energy device, such as the 'Gray Motor' (U.S. Patent #3,890,548), the 'Tesla Coil', and the motor of inventor Joseph Newman [see SCIENCE, 2-10-84, pages 571-2.], taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from 'EARTH RESONANCE' (about 12 cycles per second plus harmonics). They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the energy being tapped. It is important that the total 'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to 'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in order to maximize the power output. This output can also be increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER' of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet. In the case of a Tesla Coil, slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the secondary coil will enhance output power. [\"Earth Energy: Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems\", by John Bigelow, 1976, Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA 95245.] During the 1930's, an Austrian civil engineer named Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an 'IMPLOSION TURBINE' (German name, 'ZOKWENDLE'), after analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical equations to explain it. As described in the book \"A Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources\", by Dan A. Davidson, 1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a CRITICAL VELOCITY. The water then IMPLODES, no longer touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives th",

Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands. To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa. Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print. Who'd have guessed?",

Contains datas for all 50 states. Price is about $28, call to or visit in offices in Menlo Park, in Reston, Virginia (800-USA-MAPS). The Data User Services Division of the Bureau of the Census also has data on CD-ROM (TSO standard format) that is derived from USGS 1:100,000 map data. Call (301) 763-4100 for more info or they have a BBS at (301) 763-1568. [ From Dr.Dobbs #198 March 1993: ] \"The U.S. Defense Mapping Agency, in cooperation with their counterpart agencies in CANADA, the U.K., and Australia, have released the Digital Chart of the World (DCW). This chart consists of over 1.5 gigabytes of reasonable quality vector data distributed on four CD-ROMS. .... includes coastlines, rivers, roads, railrays, airports,cities, towns, spot elevations, and depths, and over 100,000 place names.\" It is ISO9660 compatible and only $200.00 available from: U.S. Geological Survey P.O.

CIA World Map II ---------------- [ NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured. If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ] Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above) The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360 array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for every half degree longitude and latitude. A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11). There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>. The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it. (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package. NCAR data --------- NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of terrain data, ranging from elevation datasets at various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc. This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape, IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available). Their data archive is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented. For more information, email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

    "text": "molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry. Computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects. While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology, simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists. Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing. This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming (IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video recording equipment. Audience: researchers and students in the chemical and biological sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art computer graphics into their research; computer scientists wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of scientific visualization. The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a first-come first-served basis. Level: Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix, X-windows and C is useful but not required. Date: June 14-25, 1993 (2 Credits) June 14-18, 1993 (1 or 0 credits) Time: Mon-Fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm Cost: 0 or 1 credit $410 2 credits $820 Format The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility where computer workstations will be available. Daily lectures will be interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given more time for project development and meet daily to share experience and discuss problems encountered. Content (may vary) Elements of computer graphics polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow programming (DX), interactivity. Representing the atom size, time and energy scales basic classical and quantum mechanics Important categories of molecules small molecules, biopolymers, surfaces and catalysts, miscellaneous current applications Data formats and conversions Advanced molecular graphics techniques Types of simulation and experiment electronic structure, molecular dynamics/mechanics electrostatics, X-ray crystallography, NMR, quantum dynamics and spectroscopy. Instructors The course will be taught by two instructors. Topics related to computer graphics will be handled by Dr. Bruce Land, Project Leader of Visualization, Cornell National Supercomputing Facility. Chemistry-specific aspects of the course will be handled by Dr. Richard E. Gillilan, Visualization Specialist and Research Scientist, Cornell National Supercomputing Facility TO REGISTER: mail completed form to Cornell University School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions B20 Day Hall Ithaca, NY 14853-2801 Questions: Richard Gillilan (607) 254-8757 richard@tc.cornell.edu IMPORTANT: Acceptance will be first-come, first-served and based on a target class size of 15 full-credit and 10 single or non-credit participants.

    "text": "I suppose you don't know what about we have discussed. We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit, and my suggestion above works perfectly with it. So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway, and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place. Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image. Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way, jumps off the discussion a bit. My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly. About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the mentioned type images. Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that. Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen... It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that. Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say, person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error. I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design. So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit. Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where 'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem. (Americans: the lift is just an example :) Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to read it.",

I need help finding a company that will take photographic images scanned in and modified by Adobe Photoshop and turn them into thermal prints or negatives. I am looking for a place as close to North Carolina as possible. The images will be created on a Macintosh Quadra 800 running Adobe Photoshop and will then be stored in whatever format the vendor requires, perhaps 88M cartridges? The images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a 1200 dpi scanner then modified/corrected by Adobe Photoshop. If anyone could help me or even give me phone numbers to people who could I would be very grateful. Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hear from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you use and/or any peripherals or software. It seemed the Quadra 800 would be my best bet to modify photographic images. I am planning on buying a Quadra 800 with 32Megs of RAM, a 510Meg Hard Drive, a 1200 dpi scanner, 17\" Sony monitor and a 88Meg cartridge drive and perhaps a CD ROM.

Scene generators/geographical data/Maps/Data files ====================================================== DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) ------------------------------- DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) as well as other cartographic data [huge] is available from spectrum.xerox.com [192.70.225.78], /pub/map. Contact: Lee Moore -- Webster Research Center, Xerox Corp. -- Voice: +1 (716) 422 2496 Arpa, Internet: Moore.Wbst128@Xerox.Com [ Check also on ncgia.ucsb.edu (128.111.254.105), /pub/dems -- nfotis ] Many of these files are also available on CD-ROM selled by USGS: \"1:2,000,000 scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) Data\". Contains datas for all 50 states. Price is about $28, call to or visit in offices in Menlo Park, in Reston, Virginia (800-USA-MAPS). The Data User Services Division of the Bureau of the Census also has data on CD-ROM (TSO standard format) that is derived from USGS 1:100,000 map data. Call (301) 763-4100 for more info or they have a BBS at (301) 763-1568. [ From Dr.Dobbs #198 March 1993: ] \"The U.S. Defense Mapping Agency, in cooperation with their counterpart agencies in CANADA, the U.K., and Australia, have released the Digital Chart of the World (DCW). This chart consists of over 1.5 gigabytes of reasonable quality vector data distributed on four CD-ROMS. .... includes coastlines, rivers, roads, railrays, airports,cities, towns, spot elevations, and depths, and over 100,000 place names.\" It is ISO9660 compatible and only $200.00 available from: U.S. Geological Survey P.O.

Bourke). Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail archive servers. Check with Archie. Commercial: Vista Pro 3.0 for the Amiga from Virtual Reality Labs -- list price is about $100. Their address is: VRL 2341 Ganador court San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 Telephone or FAX (805) 545-8515 Scenery Animator (also for the Amiga) is of the same caliber with Vista Pro 2. Check with: Natural Graphics P.O. Box 1963 Raklin, CA 95677 Phone (916) 624-1436 Don't forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes. Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs. CIA World Map II ---------------- [ NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured. If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ] Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above) The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360 array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for every half degree longitude and latitude. A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11). There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>. The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it. (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package. NCAR data --------- NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of terrain data, ranging from elevation datasets at various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc. This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape, IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available). Their data archive is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented. For more information, email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu. UNC data tapes with voxel data -------------- There are 2 \"public domain\" tapes with data for the comparison and testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill. (softlab@cs.unc.edu) The data sets (volu",

I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon). But here's a brief summary... PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices. Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called \"PEX\". PEXlib is a slightly \"lower\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X. Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of \"policy\" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing). PEXlib will give you access to all of these features. Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation. If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib. Either way, you will find that both API's have a lot in common.",

Any three of them must be non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them). A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC and CA meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle. This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere. Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles to the ABC one. Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal). Algorithm: Is the sphere well defined? (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure). (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure).

    "text": "First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well. I suggest that the weakness is your reference material. Get \"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm. You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam. On to the question. The simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity. For example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^). So, you get some illumination equation like this: I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity, as is the light due to transparency. Now, a slightly less hand-waving illumination equation is this: I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt. So the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a purple-colored glass object. Hopefully this answers your question. I'll forward my \"illumination equation sermon\" to you also.",

    "text": "Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasn't dealt with CGM, ASN.1, CDA, DCA, SGML, or any one of a number of other very successful file format. People seem perfectly capable dealing with these others. Dealing with the format of TIFF is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and FAX encoding of the image data. The majority of the libraries which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather than with simply decoding the tags and parameters. Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous. That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about using it in many instances. GIF is very nice for use in low-end photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems. FAX is nice, but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well). JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end. The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle all these situations (and then some). Naturally it's more complex. But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday. You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes but please don't wrail against it's complexity. The complexity it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially viable file formats.",

    "text": "Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest Announcement) WHAT IS ACCESS.bus? ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer peripheral connectivity. ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to a single PC port. Peripheral devices such as keyboards or keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC. Applications such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts Plug and Play on every PC. The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of systems and peripherals. Multiple devices connect to the host computer with only one port. Common communication methods for a number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software development. As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device. ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: ===================================== ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without fee or royalty. ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture. That is, a single host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices. ACCESS.bus data rate is 100 Kbits/sec. ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware protocol, with one data line and one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock synchronization. ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol. I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing data. I2C provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with different clock rates. Bus transactions include addressing, framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the receiver. BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between a host computer and multiple peripherals. The host becomes the ACCESS.bus manager. The Base Protocol defines the format of an ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot plugging. Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches. Hot plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the system is running, without rebooting. APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular types of devices. Each type requires a different Application Protocol. Three broad device types have been identified: keyboards, locators, and text devices. ACCESS.bus support on the PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the PC. An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices. An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with the ACCESS.bus device drivers. Drivers are available for multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and Windows 3.1. Also available are C language source code examples of the interface from applications to the device drivers. To Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):",

    "text": "FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24 in Orlando, Florida. The conference was organized by the Rensse- laer Design Research Center in co-operation with IEEE and SIG- GRAPH. Attendees came from five countries spanning three con- tinents. A good cross-section of the PHIGS community was represented at this conference with participants including PHIGS users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan- dards committee members, and researchers from industry and academia. The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS users to \"take charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS implementors. The closing speaker, Dr. Andries Van Dam, described his vision of the future of graphics standards \"beyond PHIGS\". Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the following topics: PHIGS and X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues, Texture Mapping, NURBS, PHIGS Extensions, and Object-Oriented Libraries and Frameworks. Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using PHIGS, and Portability Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences. The conference also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang- ing from mathematics for 3D graphics to object-oriented tools based on PHIGS. Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994. PHIGS EVERYWHERE At the conference, PHIGS vendors described and demonstrated PHIGS products that run on all types of computers, from PCs to mainframes. Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing and translucency. Template Graphics Software launched FIGARO+ PRO, the Photo- Realistic Option for PHIGS+. FIGARO+ PRO is designed to add advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like ray tracing, materials, anti-aliasing and texture mapping. Radiosity support is also planned. FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly emerging graphics features to their products. FIGARO+ supports immediate mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL, HP Starbase and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer. TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a powerful \"2-call\" charting system based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object- oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers. G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS on Silicon Graphics workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver- sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's PHIGS+ library for worksta- tions, will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS internal state. G5G also described their Non-Duplicated Data Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS CSS for more efficient use of memory. In addition, G5G described their application GSE that allows application callback functions during GPHIGS traversal. GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual- izer and application development toolkit, are currently available on all major workstations that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or Starbase. Wise Software presented a slide show of Z-PHIGS for MS-Windows and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most of the PHIGS+ primitives. In addition Z-PHIGS has built in many advanced rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera- tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of Z-PHIGS or ARENA is available on request. ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS implemen- tation based on DEC PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor- porates PEX support. Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital Equipment Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS. DEC PHIGS V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with support for PEX V5.1 protocol. DEC PHIGS also contains most GM/EDS PHIGS extensions including post-to-view as well as proprietary extensions to support immediate mode rendering and the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment. AXP, DEC, and DEC PHIGS are trademarks of Digital Equipment Cor- poration. GRAFPAK-PHIGS and ATC are trademarks of Advanced Tech- nology Center. PEX and X11 are trademarks of Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology. The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340 workstation running graPHIGS and PEX. Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference. A Hewlett Packard machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics PEX terminal. HP showcased their latest PHIGS product enhance- ments.

The long answer is yes - but a few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are the same, you know! As far as \"many bugs\" go, it would probably be more useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-) Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix Sun Solaris so it is possible. The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it. As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read the few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see anything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't see anything there, then this is definitely a problem! One final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it. If you are interested, then please remember that I'm not asking for any money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism, maybe that will get results??",

    "text": "It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion. Below is a very short description of the process which we use; if you have further questions, feel free to poke me via e-mail. ================================================================ *ASSUME: locally smooth distortion 0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points. This defines the set of neighbors for each point. If your data are not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull. Consider deleting these edges. 1) Now, there are two goals: a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y) b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s) as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured using the digitized (x,y)'s). 2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b). For example: a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)). This will slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the Reference(x,y). b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge. For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements. This will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh. 3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much). alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation. Consider how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges. WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and you can't allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles. Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions. When we first did this, the triangulation time was prohibitive, so we only did it once. If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I *might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration. If you have more compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having every point interact with every other point....but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem. There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on springs, constraints, and energy calculations which are relevant. The above method is described, in more or less detail in: @inproceedings{Sloan86, author=\"Sloan, Jr., Kenneth R. and David Meyers and Christine A.~Curcio\", title=\"Reconstruction and Display of the Retina\", booktitle=\"Proceedings: Graphics Interface '86 Vision Interface '86\", address=\"Vancouver, Canada\", pages=\"385--389\", month=\"May\", year=1986 } @techreport{Curcio87b, author=\"Christine A.~Curcio and Kenneth R.~Sloan and David Meyers\", title=\"Computer Methods for Sampling, Reconstruction, Display, and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts\", number=\"TR 87-12-03\", institution=\"Department of Computer Science, University of Washington\", address=\"Seattle, WA\", month=\"December\", year=1987 } @article{Curcio89, author=\"Christine A.~Curcio and Kenneth R.~Sloan and David Meyers\", title=\"Computer Methods for Sampling, Reconstruction, Display, and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts\", journal=\"Vision Research\", volume=29, number=5, pages=\"529--540\", year=1989 }",

JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard. JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings. JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression. Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively. JPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in. The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans. If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye. A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters. This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality. You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc. Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression. [2] Why use JPEG? There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images. Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time! (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one. More details below.) If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images. Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance). Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply. It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file. I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself. The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors). If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you. Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-",

In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache. The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside. My experience tells the second method is relible. Hope this helps.",

Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE. Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face. And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface. Find the average of the vertices in this surface. Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation. If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly. If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE). If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.

It \"There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry. The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's.\" Where has the hacker ethic gone? Not the \"cracker\" ethic, which is something entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative? Why is it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry? Why is it that, if a person like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks, crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely ignored) Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products? I ask those of you who call yourselves hackers, why is this? And further, how can you let it go on? It is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so for a long time to come. It has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller than it was before. I shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the 286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public. That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me. In fact, I applaud it; that is the American way. But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the problem. And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time. I put it to you thus: Where HAS the hacker ethic gone? If it still exists, where? And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves \"hackers\" allowing this to perpetuate itself? Why are they not creating new, innovative, interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry?

    "text": "Archive-name: rec-autos/part5 [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers. -- rpw] [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw] Commonly Asked Automotive Questions Tire Questions: Q: What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean? A: Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14. the 195 is the overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually narrower. The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width. Our example tire has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm. The 14 is the wheel diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX' tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like 390, which is in millimeters. The R means Radial, and the H is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate. Common speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to 150MPH.) Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice. What follows is a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum per-tire loads: Load Index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 Max Load (Kg) 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table. In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation indicates Passenger car. If no letter is given, then the application of the tire is Passenger car usage. As far as I know, these letters only appear in the US market. The LT designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles. For the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at all. If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78. Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.) There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature, traction, and treadwear. Temperature and Traction are graded A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is a numeric rating. These values are of limited value, as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires. Q: My car has tires with a funny size designation: 185/65HR390; can i put normal tires on the car? A: Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin. Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.) You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner, or possibly blow out at high speed.) TRX type tires are becoming hard to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires. Goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires. Q: Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side of my car? A: Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping is done. The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations. Q: How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the car should I put them on? A: In short, 4, and both ends. To explain, many drivers in areas that don't get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice. With a rear wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car (a function of the front axle.) In a front wheel drive car, you start, stop, and turn with the front end. The primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on ",

Here's a summary of the replies I received. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm not under 25 anymore (but is 27 close enough). 1992 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (300hp model). No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1, airbag, abs, security alarm, single. $1500/year $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house) The base policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE. After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less. I bought the car in September 1992. The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500. Hope this helps. Steve Flynn University of Delaware ======================================================================== 45 Kevin: (Hope I remembered your name correctly)... You asked about insurance for performance cars. Well, last year I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the same inquiry as you. Age: 24 (then and now) Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD Driving Record: Clean State: Illinois Cost: $820/6 mos. I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos. Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company. I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe I'm just lucky.

The forecast calls for Thunder...'89 T-Bird SC \"It's a hell of a thing, killing a man. You take away all he has and all he's ever gonna have.\" --Will Munny, \"Unforgiven\" ======================================================================== 61 I am beyond the \"under 25\" age group, but I have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you. I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT. I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car. Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two. I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche. The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car. It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way. I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car. \"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer. Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account. \"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double. And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\" \"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944. That doens't make sense.\" That's what the book says. We don't insure Corvettes, either. For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\" I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons. The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room. At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance. I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft. /|/| /||)|/ /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~ | Everyone's entitled to MY opinion. / | |/ ||\\|\\ \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_| | goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein======= ==",

In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go (and I saw it coming both times). If you _really_ want to add safety to _any_ car, simply add a cage to the car. They are available and cheap (about $500 in the USA). Add to that four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that were otherwise not survivable. but instead of people spending a little extra money, we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal level of protection for everyone. One other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get some training. This will improve your safety more than any other single investment will. Drive/ride defensively (and that does not mean you have to be a doddering old stick in the mud). People here tend to enthuse about autos more than the average (probably in the top 15th percentile in driving ability), but still we sometimes overlook the obvious. I've been to two driving schools, and three riding schools for my motorcycle. A very worthwhile investment (and besides, it was a lot of fun too ;-). Safety is what you make of it, just because a carmaker doesn't provide you with an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go at that.",

In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly. For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \"parking lights\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \"cornering lamps\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \"backup lights\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.

I thought it was worth looking into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story about her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems, ending with engine noises which she said \"was something with the heads\", that Ford acknowledged the noise, said they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of yet. Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not the same car). So I have some evidence of a reoccuring problem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extension with the Madza 626 and MX-6.",

Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel Vehicles To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806 WASHINGTON, April 21 -- Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a \"driving force behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative fuel vehicles and fuel supplies.\" President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order. \"I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make this happen,\" O'Leary said. \"As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural gas vehicles in speeches across the country.\" The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending a plan and schedule of implementation. \"The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,\" O'Leary said. \"Increased use of domestically-produced alternative fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs. We believe that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy economy are complimentary goals.\" O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make fleet conversions practical. Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely available. -30-",

Then i did the unthinkable and blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000) 2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out of a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers i took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask, but it was a Wagoneer). Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear axels, ford 9\" and a dana 44 up front. Watch the rear axel wrap, i busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and haven't had a problem since. Also the bottom of the doors tend to rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones that might be in your budget. The post 80 broncos have that sickly TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were as the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective wheel travel). The only rust i have is on my doors and a few dings in the sheet metal. I don't know when the removeable tops were discontinued but they are fun. I just ordered a full convertable top for 400$ for mine(credit card). Don't ever break the window if you have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over 400 bucks to replace. My bronco also does pretty good offroad, i haven't bottomed out my suspension, YET, and have crossed over 3 foot deep of water with no problems, handles rocks like a charm too. One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or a Toyota, between two rocks or trees, and your grandmother will have a hard time getting up into it.",

Parts are over priced also. One of my friend had accident in past snow storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender. Well, if you test drive Land Cruiser, all other SUV look like toys. One of magazine writer called it \"Land Bruiser\". If you have $40,000 to spare for SUV, get Land Cruiser and forget Lange Rover.",

Response welcomed. : : PS. my initial question is \"how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW\" : : Derek There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights. It will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try di it yourself. You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset. Why is reseting so important? The only reason for doing it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you. Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every 15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and extending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't wait for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car. I bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changed the oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil, air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils and done almost all of the other things req for service 1 and a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights. After a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad. Good luck!

Having a trade-in on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing. I assume this is _retail_ bluebook. There are two bluebook prices, one for retail and one for wholesale. You really want the retail price if you can get it. The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car. You should look all this stuff up yourself. Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area. For example, blue book prices are low for California. A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices. It might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for 6 months for the best price). I don't know what you mean by \"an acquaintance\" but I would make darn sure that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery. There's a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating than you should. Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go elsewhere. Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook. That's probably a safer approach than selling to a private party. --",

Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a shortage. GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next year (according to a WSJ article). Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in Popular Mechanics. I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 1993 issue (p30). Direct side on view.

I wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40 registry (as of '88 or so). There were precious few of them made (fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough to qualify for the Manufacturer's Cup, or whichever series it was that Shelby broke Ferarri's 13-year winning streak in in '65), and they are all accounted for. The last price I saw estimated on a GT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that's right, ONE MILLION US DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari that it would blow the doors off of ;-). I don't recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although I'm certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify for racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think, and/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They also used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the original trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was rear-engine, rear-drive, with the \"bundle of snakes\" exhaust headers...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I can't remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe...I'll try and find that reference.

    "text": "I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer. The design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM. The idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM. The secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used. The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable. This was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in operation. The case, of course, might not be the same for your 1993 RX-7! The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated. Since steering angle and velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers' use of the car. I am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ECM. While it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style, it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars. I personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.",

He has a big mouth, but he does get the job done when he concentrates. I think the situation with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing. I think he might have realized something when the Marlins or Rockies didn't select him. The Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now. Kamieniecki and Wickman/Militello in the bullpen? Ouch.

    "text": "Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football. Last year I hardly watched a game. What turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game. A team scores. 2.5 minutes of commercials. Kickoff. 1.5 minutes of commercials. Three downs and a punt. 2 minutes of commercials. AAAAARRRRGH! Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's, whom I believe institutionalize slow play. I don't mind the cat-and-mouse game with Rickey on first; in fact, I rather enjoy it. Similarly I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first. What I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first, or when the game is a blowout. I don't mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration. What I object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity. When a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game. When the delays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the commercial breaks in football. I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to \"speed up\" the games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster. That did not address the problem of the continuity of the game. It may have appeased the sponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans. Similary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch. I doubt if anyone watching the Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out. I doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present. I would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball. On the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do. I sure wouldn't mind a little arm-twisting there. -- The Beastmaster",

If Sandy Alderson and the Haas family willingly negotiate a salary of $35 million per year with Rickey, I couldn't care less. But what REALLY GETS MY GOAT is the bullshit he spouted in spring training, about `Well... sometimes I may not play as hard, or might be hurt more often, in a place where I'm not appreciated'. This quote was in the Chronicle about the second week of camp, and strongly suggests that he was going to dog it all year if the ownership didn't kiss his butt and ante up some more money. For God's sake, Rickey, you signed a contract 4 years ago, now honor it and play! Say all you want to about Steve Garvey, and believe me, I hated him too, but at least when he put his signature on a piece of paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up.",

Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and pitching. I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often.

Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score, and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out. So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces. Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, \"I don't want a repeat of that near-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work.\" Steve Howe, whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the Royals win it, 6-5. What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together, Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once. What's the deal? We finally have terrific starting pitching, so all of a sudden, our bullpen turns to shit! What's Buck gonna do? And what's George gonna do if this continues to happen?",

At least it's better than fielding percentage: Carney Lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 FR, dead last of all time. Also, since this total rating compares players to league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be awarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games. He had a great career, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman. But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack. That's a similar story, Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's superior fielding. Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better choices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports this point of view.) Shouldn't that be right field?",

    "text": "Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you have a hockey background. Stats like \"plus/minus\" make RBI look good. OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please answer yes or no, Roger: Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs? AL only, please. For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite, hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs, for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game. So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238 for Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in (particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \"had Morris performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\" This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

    "text": "I'm still catching up from Spring Break, but bear with me... Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them, at AAA. Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues. Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please let me know.) But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle- of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed. Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players. Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as \"TWG\" without the caps. It's a losing strategy to say, \"We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.\" You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW. Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years, Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference, IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast. \"Two big bats.\" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing. Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA. (Got that, Mike?) And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway? Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on, Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in 1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year? You're mostly polite; make defensible, if flawed cases; have wit and have, in the past, admitted being wrong. That does qualify you on r.s.b. We'll make an SDCN out of you, yet :-)",

We'll see if he's still around in 1994 for his tenth year. Same goes for Herm. Doesn't count then. Redus is hardly light-hitting, plus he stole 300 bases. Close to 800 OPS career against LHP. We'll see if he's still around in 1995 to qualify. Slugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters' parks in the NL. He's going to be one of Colorado's better players this year. Plus, to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver and Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox. Coleman, assuming he makes it to 1994, was never perceived as being weak offensively, though of course he was. Led NL in SB his first six years in the majors. We'll see if he's still around in 1997. Wilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year stretch and led the league in triples five times. But we can count him if he's still playing in 1994, though it'll be because he's Otis Nixon deluxe with slightly worse defense. Okay, if he's in the league this year, he can count, though he's also in the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome. He's not spectacular, but he's neither light-hitting nor a ten-year man. Halfway there, and unlikely to make it 3/4 of the way there. Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease, but he wasn't perceived as light-hitting. Neither was Curt Flood.

    "text": "Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and predictions for the A.L. out. Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest. AL East -- 1993 1. Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles? Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this: -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction. -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees -- Milwaukee was a fluke -- Indians aren't ready to contend -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\" \"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\" No. As a matter of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate). But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles. \"You don't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?\" No. I'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis. \"Glenn Davis? That's insane\". Yes. So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS: Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS: Segui may start. Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be the fifth starter. Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup. (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize the effect of a slumping Ripken? If you can't move Ripken out of the #3 spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction: \"The Streak\" continues. Harold Reynolds leads the team in caught stealing. 2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS: Abbot, Key, Perez. Could have best pitching in American League. Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS: Mattingly still considered best hitter. The Steinbrenner factor. (The Yankees lost to the Mets. Can wholesale changes be far behind?) Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction: Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS. 3. Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS: Management willing to make big deals. Management has eerie power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects. Olerud. Guzman. Alomar. WEAK POINTS: The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick. Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign). No one in the outfield can get on base. Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction: Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year. And have a losing record. 4. Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS: Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS: Molitor gone. Surhoff at third? Why? Eldred can't keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN: Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction: Surhoff won't finish the year at third. 5. Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS: Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS: Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts. Starts Felix Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction: Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break. 6. Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS: Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS: Most incompetent GM in baseball. Key free agent signing -- Andre Dawson. Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Clemens on the DL ObPrediction: Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon. Interpret that how you will :-> 7. Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS: Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS: If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year. Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better. This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction: Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs. One more division to go.... -- Dale J.

Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem. It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell curve. (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting vs. non-clutch; the Y-axis being the number of players.) Certainly there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell. My *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players (as opposed to all baseball players). As a counterexample to You won't hear those kind of accusations from me. It is interesting that you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also looked at. He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA), hitting in 1989 - 92 .217, .273, .250, .272 Admittedly, he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs. His clutch hitting record is equally inconsistent. So, for my purposes in 1993 I would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance. I don't know how I would have felt in 1988, but you may indeed be right. When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non-clutch BA. Ditto for Joe Carter. This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having with others on this topic. Must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity? Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base? I completely accept that reasoning. Again, what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis? amen. -- The Beastmaster",

On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense.

Extra innings could put me well past midnight. Even without extra innings, if the score is beyond 2-1 I can't see my family that night at all. If the next day is a workday, I may have to bag that as well. Further, the later the game goes, the colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie. All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game. If you say you don't care about whether the game is sped up, IMPO you are saying you don't care where the time goes, and that the game is for people who don't have families and don't have to get up for work the next day.

I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds. The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey. To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo. Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray. The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties. With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be.",

    "text": "Thanks for posting this and making it available. This post will be LONG, I will comment on most of it, and am reluctantly leaving all of the original in place to provide context. Please note that an alt. group has been set up for the Clipper stuff. ^^^^^^^^^ Hum, AT&T, VLSI and Mykotronx are 'industry'? Wonder what happened to IBM, this should be right up their street. And a mandateed scheme is voluntary? Mr Orwell would love this. ^^^^^^^^^ Telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like RSA, IDEA, or even DES. The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim in the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like. I would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun- ications than this lot. Normmaly DES. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Note the use of the word \"business\" in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \"business\" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys. The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper! Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NSA Yeah, this bit is VERY true. Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo of the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment I suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies. ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again. Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word \"ensure\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you. So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions, the answer in this press release is, YES. Just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent. Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved. Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-) And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it. After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own actions. ^^^^^^^^ Again, personal use seems to be a unaskable question. ^^^^^ Ah, so warrents are not always needed it seems. The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this. Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge. Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century. It is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal. Note we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be rephrased as \" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast.\" This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is a real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them? Just make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully, OK. Quick, with out looking back, What name is missing from that list? The people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them. The reverse engineering provisions of the 'Mask-work' act could be relevent here. You don't. Not unless you are one of the 'right people'. They missed the word secret here. He needs a grammar lesson too. I would say \"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ), less available, and more prone to being comprimised\" Proofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF. They don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this prop",

For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)? This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant). Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business. I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative. If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?). This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

A: This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review. [...bs about the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...] The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have effectively done); They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public. nor is the U.S. saying that \"every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.\" Maybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment. There is a false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is an \"either-or\" proposition. Rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper Chip\" and similar encryption techniques. Nice lullaby. But why am I not soothed? ---------------- Also, Why repeat themselves? It appears to some (and the story looks pretty convincing to me, too) that the Justice Department stole a case-tracking system, modified it, and distributed it to \"friendly\" police and suchlike agencies around the world, eg. the Canadian Mounties.

    "text": "April 16, 1993 INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of Americans. The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology. However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed. Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor. Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant. The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products. This proposal raises a number of serious concerns . First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry. The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other chips. Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards. Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified. EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open. The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny. Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted. What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries? These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to answer. In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security. However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the discussion even begins. DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL: ESCROW The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40-bits of each key. The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents. A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it. Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents. According to the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents. Some in the Administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen, but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet. CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm. In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors. The results of the investigation would then be made public. The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source, secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms: VLSI and Mycotronx. NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four years. The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago. GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product. Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. At today's Commerce Department press briefing, a number of people asked this question, though: why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guarant",

    "text": "I wish I could agree with you. Ask yourself this. Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance) Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated? (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't. There is other hardware out there not compromised. DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.) My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems. If not we're in trouble. Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously. The only way their moves can work is by coercion. You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise. The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \"Clipper\" system is easily justified \"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government? We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ? You simply can't, and the administration knows it. Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems. Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato. Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast? They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better. Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to. AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun? I really wonder. To wit: The letter I just sent to Clinton: The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461 April 17, 1993 Sir and/or Madam: I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography. I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life. It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed. Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors. The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm. The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance. In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy. It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be. I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws. I can only assume then that the drafters of the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector. The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion. Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti lize the \"Big Brother Chip.\" Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing. I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \"harmony,\" \"right to encryption,\" and \"voluntary.\" It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \"I can't believe it's happening here.\" More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\" Most Concerned, [Signature] Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu",

By \"almost\" I mean the differential cryptanalysis attack. The chosen plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 2^36 chosen plaintexts drawn from a total of about 2^47 that need to be run, if I understand the situation correctly. This is certainly a \"break\" under the meaning of the Act, but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch. The rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the Skipjack encryption algorithm E by choosing the correct data to send through it and observe the results. I wish him joy of it, and choose not to try that attack. I am not defending the system, and in fact am offended by the ideas of escrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard. However, I also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons, since that weakens the case against it. I said (in my private e-mail): No, it's quite different. The government would have no percentage in choosing F to be a weak key, since it's not to their advantage to have anybody else know it. The \"experts\" could thus assume that F is no worse than anything else during their analysis. Totally different situation from unknown S-boxes. Again, I'm not saying it would be good or satisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without the rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and so on -- simply that I doubt that they <would> be given all the information.",

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens and paper. Can people work within the system before trying to break it? Examine your history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic (or Democratic style) governments. I think you'll only find one in over five thousand years of written history. That's not very good odds. Somebody once said something like: \"Armed Violence is meant only to be used in response to an armed attack. It is not meant to be used in agression.

Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug. Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and the FBI gets their pet \"wiretap without leaving the office\" scheme. There is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours, everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible. Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed. Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not willing to make that leap of faith. I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world. All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it? If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick. Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny. I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere. -- Perry Metzger pmetzger@shearson.com",

They would be well concealed so you wouldn't know the location, to prevent you from covering the lens opening. After all, nothing you're doing would be of the slightest interest to a government official, right? So, you surely should not object to such a proposal... Not the best anology, but the principle is pretty close - the ability to eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort, without your knowlege, protected by entirely by \"government safeguards\". You can still draw your curtains, so you can still have your privacy from everyone else (except Big Brother)!! After all we need this for protection from drug dealers and terrorists and other criminals (like 'enemies of the STATE')... and you don't really have a right to \"unbreakable\" privacy anyway, sort of as the press release of the Clinton Cripple DECISION puts it...

They wouldn't want to be able to break it ILLEGALLY, would they?)... Nawww, not \"for the People\" Clinton.... Can you, while my mind is on it, give us one good reason that the algorithm should be a secret algorithm, unless this encryption scheme either is a joke, or contains features like a 'master key' or other back door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping? If it was really even moderately secure, and the government really meant to require the proper court order and the keys that are in the Escrow accounts to be able to decipher the traffic, what is the need to keep the algorithm secret? Seems I hear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm to remain a secret to be effective, it is not a worthwhile scheme... is this just idle talk, or is the Administration bullshitting everyone? With GREAT skepticism, and many doubts on our Administrations intentions... And WAIT!! We haven't been told the NEXT gem the Administration has in mind for e-mail and datafile security.

First, law enforcement agencies can of course do this. Second, they're only forbidden from BUDGETING any money for it. The IRS, for example, does do this anyhow. They just don't spend any money on it so it's (technically) legal I guess. Instead they probably trade little favors with companies like mastercard (if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a *lot* of opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases.)

Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast as a \"classified patent.\" Patents exist to encourage communications and develop the state of the art. While there aren't classified patents, there are \"patent secrecy orders\". Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio, and apply for a patent. The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested, gives them a copy of your application, and you get a nice note back saying your patent application has now been classified for national security reasons and you're no longer allowed to make and sell it. I'm picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s. It was probably some analog scrambler, and would have probably violated FCC rules anyway, but it did get classified. Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and then file a patent application. Since it's been published, they can't gain anything by classifying it, though you can't get patents in most countries other than the US, where patent laws are different.

Unlike me, he thinks that our friends in the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen the slow but steady erosion to the south of us. We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any time they actually go after somebody just because they don't like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme Court, not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under). Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop fighting each other long enough to do any really effective suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend off a bent cop. It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed order, while the nation founded on Peace, Order and Good Government is getting in-your-face liberty. That's not to say our time won't come. It looks like Chretien is going to run on a law-and-order platform. Be afraid.

    "text": "My original post was: This article will just scratch the surface of a few security considerations, comments are requested. (email: fw@world.std.com) My thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from Oracle Corp. The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit features or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$ included suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to use table views to refine the granularity of access control. One important security consideration in networked installations is that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user authentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the _least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably not define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access of OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle servers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv option), while relying on host security for local processes. Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and data access. These tools can be used to track the primary security risks from within the Oracle environment. Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES encryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone to cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate since the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users choose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access to your oracle database files through the host operating system, s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords. As security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity. Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files, s/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break the passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without alerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail which would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix) provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not guessable. As with all computer security, the most important defense is to educate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques are well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, (both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System Security (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992)",

The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant. That's the rule today. But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered. I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal. Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\" can they? Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system. They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.

Some of these records are confidential. So the concept of a court holding information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal precedents. The judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be. So judicial control of keys is appropriate. For the other half of the key, I suggest a unit of Congress, the General Accounting Office. The GAO is Congress's staff unit for keeping tabs on the Executive Branch, and has an excellent reputation. It's controlled strictly by Congress; the Executive Branch has no authority over it.

Do you think I <will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they <can keep track of what I'm saying? Even if there is no evidence of my <guilt? Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle <in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind? I'm tired <of it. There is (IMHO) no compromise with an administration that seeks <to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy. < <More than the proposals themselves, I read the language of the press <releases, the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to <the public, and I am sickened. I am revolted. I am repulsed. < <90%, perhaps even 95% of this country could care less about the <clipper chip, the wiretap bill, the smart card, because they are so <entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration. The problem is, the people are not having the scope, or implicataions pointed out to them. Hell, most haven't even heard of Clipper, and when they do, it will be in soothing language telling everyone how nice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy. How come the media is not telling about the provisions of the Clipper decision? The provisions of the Crime Bill? The abuses of Civil Forfeiture? The government uses polls to support 75 percent of the people want gun bans, etc., yet the same pollsters have determined (according to the media) that 30 percent of the people are unaware of what the Holocaust is... The people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are denied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of rights are going on quietly. When they find out (when it hits them), it will be too late. One cannot expect each citizen to spend all their time probing, searching, researching, etc. For example, how big a percentage of the average population even has access to USENET? Way less than 1 percent, I bet. How many outside of Internet/USENET are even AWARE of what Big Brother is doing, or have been exposed to arguments of both sides of the issue? What the public will get is only ONE side: The Government's side. THAT is scary. < <This saddens and frightens me. < <I am a conserveative believe it or not. A law and order conserveative. <But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me, <mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the <intelligence of the American people. Tell them it's going to keep <them safe from drug dealers and terrorists, and they will let you <put cameras in their home. How can the bulk of the people be informed, when the media refuses to do it? <Even in the wake of Waco, you find those who support the increasingly <totalatarian moves. < <>Somebody once said something like: \"Armed Violence is meant only to be <>used in response to an armed attack. It is not meant to be used in <>agression. This is the difference between self-defence and murder.\" < <To be quite honest, the way things are going, I'd call it self defense. < <>Let's try to avoid killing things, eh? There's enough blood shed in the <>world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc. <> <>I'm probably overreacting. But what I've read scared me a lot.

    "text": "This is the file BIGNUMS.TXT from ripem.msu.edu, last updated April 1993. In response to Email requests, I have assembled this list of large-integer arithmetic packages of which I have heard. Most of these are C function libraries, available in source form. For your convenience, I have placed copies of some of these on ripem.msu.edu (35.8.1.178). They are available for anonymous FTP in the directory \"pub/bignum\". However, what I have may not be the most current version in all cases. Here they are, in no particular order: mp Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes Multiple precision package accessed via -lmp flag on your compiler. Provides +, -, *, /, gcd, exponentiation, sqrt. Comes with SunOS, NeXT Mach, BBN Mach 1000, and probably a few others. See \"man mp\". Object code only, of course. PARI Henri Cohen, et al., Universite Bordeaux I, Paris, FRANCE Multiple precision desk calculator and library routines. Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola 68020, semi-optimized code for SPARC, and apparently rather slow generic C version. Does both integers and reals. Does vectors and matrices as well as scalars. Contains a number of advanced functions, some of which I've never heard of. (\"Weber's function\"?) Has a factorization function, primality test, & other related stuff. Plenty of TEX documentation. Public domain, but you can't distribute modified versions. Available via anonymous FTP from math.ucla.edu. There seem to be Mac- and NeXT-specific versions there in addition to: Filename: pari-1.35a.tar.Z Arithmetic in Global Fields (Arith) Kevin R. Coombes, David R. Grant Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or polynomials over finite fields. Includes basic +, -, *, / and a few others like gcd. Source code in C. Distributed under the terms of the GNU public license. Includes man pages and TEX documentation. Filename: arith.tar.Z Arbitrary Precision Math Library Lloyd Zusman Los Gatos, CA C package which supports basic +, -, *, /. Provides for radix points (i.e., non-integers). Not as polished as the others here. Posted to comp.sources.misc in October 1988. Filename: apml.tar.Z BigNum J. Vuillemin, INRIA, FRANCE, and others. Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab (DECPRL) A \"portable and efficient arbitrary-precision integer\" package. C code, with generic C \"kernel\", plus assembly \"kernels\" for MC680x0, Intel i960, MIPS, NS32032, Pyramid, and of course VAX. This is probably one of the better-known packages of this type. Implements +, -, *, /, mod, plus logical operations OR, AND, XOR. Both signed and unsigned arithmetic available. Available via email from librarian@decprl.dec.com. You will receive 5 shell archives. Give your postal address and you will also receive printed documentation from France. Package includes TEX documentation. Publicly available for non-commercial use. I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL doesn't like others to distribute it. However, BIGNUM *is* distributed as part of ecpp (see below). Lenstra's package Arjen Lenstra Bellcore Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C. Includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, mod, primality testing, sqrt, random number generator, and a few others. The package was uncommented and undocumented; I have tried to add enough comments to get by. This is the only of these packages that I have actually used. It works well and is very portable. I haven't done any benchmarks against the others, but the code looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist. Unlike the other packages here, this one requires you to allocate storage statically--only a problem if your numbers are really huge. Arjen has placed the code in the public domain. Filename: lenstra.tar.Z lenstra_3.1 Arjen Lenstra, Bellcore An improved version of Arjen's package above. This one does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation (which can be turned off as an option). Has a few new routines, too. \"lenstra_3.1\" contains minor bugfixes to the previously-available \"lenstra_2\" and \"lenstra_3\". Filename: lenstra_3.1.c bmp (Brent's Multiple Precision?) R. P. Brent 1981 vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating & fixed point arithmetic. Includes most of the mathematical functions you'd find in a FORTRAN run-time library. This code is an ACM algorithm, number 524. To obtain, send a mail message to netlib@ornl.gov containing the line \"send mp.f from bmp\" or better yet, perhaps just start with \"help\". SPX Kannan Alagappan & Joseph Tardo, DEC This is a huge prototype public key authentication system based on RSA. I mention it here because those who have heard of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer package it contains is indeed DEC's BigNum from France. You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com (192.58.206.2). Use it only for testing, as it \"may\" expire on a certain date. (I don't know whether this has expired yet.)",

They enligthen ??? the use of S1 and S2 for keygeneration. ------------------------------------------- Date: Mon, 19 Apr 93 08:51:57 EDT From: denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning) Subject: Re: Clipper Chip I just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features of Clipper. Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on Clipper. The name of the encryption algorithm is \"Skipjack.\" Martin Hellman had written and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number; SK} To which I responded: My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the \"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement. Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this? I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK. However, Skipjack being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key for the family key SK. The unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the serial number N as follows. Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys. Compute the 64-bit block R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two keys.) Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3. (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change. The fact that they're called seeds suggests they might.) Then R1, R2, and R3 are concatenated together giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits form K1 and the next 80 bits form K2. The remaining bits are discarded. The seeds S1 and S2 do not change. The whole process is performed on a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both. The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire \"programming session\" to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers. Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be thrown out if desired). The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding for each value). The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired up with their serial number. Each pair is stored in a separate file. The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies. Dorothy Denning denning@cs.georgetown.edu -------------------------------------------------------- I am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by. Please remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree with it's contents and implications. So don't swamp my mailbox :-) I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical discussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you call S1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process working without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the Serial-Number. Friendly greetings, Germano Caronni",

A 'multi-line cleartext bridge?\" ^^^^^^^^^ And just were would you put that bridge? If it isn't at one of the receiptants location, forget encryption at all. You have blown any security you thought you might have had. Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are military (or equivalent, like CIA and other embassy personnel), so putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal - it's in a vault on a military base or Ft. Meade, and the secure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors because they're talking about Classified Stuff (or Golf with Other Generals.) That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob; most people don't use sound-proof vaults, and may use bridges in their PBX or from the local phone company (3-way calls) or Long Distance or value-added phone company (e.g. Alliance conference bridges). If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones, the conferencing aspects don't change. But there may be a market niche for trusted conference-bridge providers, though I suppose the inquisitors would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges, just in case a Bad Guy might use the service.",

    "text": "You are correct (several times). TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be exploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons. Among other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the printer head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the crudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some intelligence to measuring emission levels, I would find many other potential sources of leaked information. Where cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection becomes an important security hazard. In the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns, particularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the 'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release' for while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to approved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes. She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family. All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again. Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\" Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure. When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea. Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head. Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure. Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing. I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being. Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has. Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here. Thanks.",

    "text": "------------- cut here ----------------- HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 13 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 Gonorrhea -- Colorado, 1985-1992 ================================ SOURCE: MMWR 42(14) DATE: Apr 16, 1993 The number of reported cases of gonorrhea in Colorado increased 19.9% from 1991 to 1992 after declining steadily during the 1980s. In comparison, in the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from 1985 through 1992. In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age group-specific rate (639 per 100,000). Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised 94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, respectively). Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 14 Volume 6, Number 10 April 20, 1993 increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br, Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for Prevention Svcs, CDC. Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs (2).

This year I developed a pain on the other side. This turned out to be another inguinal hernia. So I go back to the hospital Monday for another fun 8-) operation. I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen. I'm 38 years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling apart like this. The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to suspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger? Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting anything? It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack full of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery sack is fairly small these days.

    "text": "Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common. The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments. I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers. (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments. He got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes. This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays. The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome. Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome. On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons. Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.) I'm not sure that it's random. But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses. If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have. If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere. Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces. Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth. I don't agree that this follows. In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend. It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process. Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out. Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''. I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design. Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme. It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational. Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds. The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.",

    "text": "Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted). OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression. Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having recurrent blasphemous thoughts. Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities. The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source. Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety. In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships. Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions. The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 . kind regards,",

Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical, biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, bridging necrosis, or fibrosis. CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe it is a continuum.

A > A > Robert Allison I tried to e-mail you, but our board is having internet problems, so I'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not. Rutin is NOT a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that) you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other major component of the bioflavonoid complex. I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be- fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin. Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole bioflavonoid complex instead. I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc... One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects. They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well. About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg. For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common. In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids. The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.' Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are: Quest.............1,000mg big, bitter, not chewable Swiss Herbal........600mg smooth, easier swallowing Jamieson............500mg medium, bitter, chewable SISU.................25mg (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck! -- Ron Roth -- ===================================================================== -- Internet: rn.3228@rose.com - Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton -- * \"Eating Radium has strange results,\" Tom said brightly.",

From time to time I experience a strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) which can be best described as the feeling of \"losing gravity\", like that one experiences in a descending elevator. Needless to say, it is not enjoyable. It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts that long, it makes me sweatening. Initially I called it \"palpitation (spelling?)\" until I later learnt that the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats. So, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne person? I always believe I am unique. Thanks.",

This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping. If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it would be a poor thing indeed. What was the methodology of Darwin? What was the methodology of Einstein? What was, for that matter, the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur? First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science, homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science. I, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky. What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention. If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist. For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed. It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies. It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly. But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as doctrinaire, cultist. This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.",

My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach? Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this affect the treatment, development?

    "text": "The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER- MONGERING \"medical\" establishment. Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in the following article: NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES A 3RD OPINION ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. ) DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable. The compiler of this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the subjects of his choice. ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store. MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food Store. What is important is HOW they are used, and what else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. ) (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind at a time, preferably grapes. 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings. 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want. Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice. (Stay close to your home bathroom.) 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS CONTAIN LAETRILE.). 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE. Squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar). Drink one glass per hour. [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH PULP.] 6th day: Same as 5th day. 7th day: Same as 6th day. All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. (2) THE GRAPE DIET. Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to 8 PM, every day for six days. Eat NOTHING else during the six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR. Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple cider \"flavored\" vinegar. Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it. Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a week. Repeat if desired. Do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods. This remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH. [Please keep an OPEN MIND.] Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in. Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, chomping your teeth together, etc.. Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the book \"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\", by Frances Nixon, 1973. PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should prepare it and drain it. For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away from, and even out of sight of, other people. (Your greatly expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt other people's fields.) Two hours after the bath, eat at least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures. (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.) Better yet, take a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune system). [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".] Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields present at those times). Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for about 2 months. D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to perform NORMAL cell functions. ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-r",

One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old). Otherwise, she is in fine health. The discovery was made via CAT scans. She then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered in her lungs. Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma. One spot is in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax. The oncologists believe the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked until four years ago). Anyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are the chances for full remission/recovery?

    "text": "Point 1: I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole \"yeast issue\" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words. Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\", necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully cognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers). For the situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large, causing significant miscommunication. One example word, and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\". It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor. There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan the flames. This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional \"difficult\" patient. Point 2: I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial. To these doctors, to do any differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice. And it follows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known. Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from a treatment point-of-view. And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment. However, as also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where \"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations. After all, the underlying intent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the patient should come first when considering treatment. What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints. In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that. The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then). The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them. This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor. It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient. And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community: either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training. This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way. Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion. Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real difficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure \"scientific\" approach to medicine. I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and by the \"scientific\" aspects. Anything else is just not good medicine, imho. Just my 'NF' leanings, I guess. :^) Comments? Jon Noring -- Charter Member --->>> INFJ Club.",

    "text": "Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde. The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time. In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above. This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed. Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent. That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic.",

The weekend was pretty bad, but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours. Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on Friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick. Skin was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain. It subsided in an hour or so. Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed to control the pain. Immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains. A friend of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused heart attacks in several people. Apparently the mild chest pains were common in these other people prior to there attacks. Is this just rumor? Has anyone else heard of these symptoms? My girlfriend also has Mitral Valve Prolapse.",

The doctor very vehemently insisted that they were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT! My wife is concerned about this. She saw a TV show a couple months back (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC, etc.) where an expert on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound. Should my wife be concerned? Should we take the pictures to a radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find such an expert in Chicago?)

Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, I've mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily. It turns out most would rather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections.

Most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule (current standard therapy). Because of the cost (usually > $150/mo., depending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like corneal injury and birth defects, I currently reserve it for those who fail conventional treatment. It is important that the person prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient closely. As far as I know, I am the only person looking at it currently.

    "text": "I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.). Here are some observations gained from painful experience: 1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person. Some people get tiny red bites. Others (like me) are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs. 2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving. I swear that these things will itch for months. 3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers. I think most of it is fiction. I have tried to do research on the critters, since they have such an effect on me. The only book I could find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special collections library. I have not yet gone through what is required to get it. 4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work. I recall reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false. I think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release. But this is speculation. 5. The *best* approach is prevention. A couple of things work well. A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start. There is another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was prepared for the Army and is not commercially available. In the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we live (in the country) without serious consequences. (They apparently don't like sulfur much at all. You can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.) 6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful. Forget the fingernail polish. I have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine (relieves the itch). I won't tell you all the things I've tried. Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think it gains nothing). 7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery as well. Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers. The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much. And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure. I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.",

    "text": "To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible. So there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context. Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible. (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.) On the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false. There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying \"You people call THIS science?\" (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.) Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation. I don't believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science. My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards. I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific. Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before the twentieth century. One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove. (Later mathematicians did prove them, of course.) I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not as it is a matter of convincing other people. (People have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an essential element. Not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science.) When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation. Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed. A considerable amount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer. The \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century. I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of \"reason and observation.\" One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies. Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.",

    "text": "Ken: Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big Boys if you're tackling Henry. Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in on the subject of staggering operational costs, too. Good luck, son. Ahem. The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be Politically Correct to contend so. It will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle. Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals. The reason people are so fond of it is that it's the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come, to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs. There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost. Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the, er, Free World's available space cash. As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-: DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental \"X-plane\" hardware. It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks. I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or building the DC-Y. I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics. I don't see a realistic prospect for beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else. If the DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space. The Nineties and the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a prospect too depressing to bear. (Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction. It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks. It's creating its own market for small payloads.) I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some of them as good as or better than SSTO. There is no sign in today's world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line. [...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...] Strawman. Is anybody seriously proposing this? References, please. The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations, as well as the \"bird in the hand\" argument your common sense tells you. If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the Shuttle, not instead of it. Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated. If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M, rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites instead of one. Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series. Little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of begging a ride. This is just supply and demand. You should be able to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a big difference in costs. Do you have some reason to think not?",

The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first question is definitely yes. (If you meant to say \"propel\" rather than \"power\", the answer is \"sort of\".) Yes, you can use interaction with the Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential applications for this. However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch. The energy isn't coming from nowhere. What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy. There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff. Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations, however. What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays, and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it. If you want more information, trying looking up \"electrodynamic propulsion\", \"tether applications\", and \"magsails\". No. A \"dragless\" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if* there was no drag. This is why there are quotes around \"dragless\".",

    "text": "This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology. There was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII. The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds. There were not that many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for travel to scientific meetings. Not that much, but it was provided, and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary. During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise. This is probably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges. This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems, the job got done. The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future, and started funding pure research after WWII. But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as NSF, to do the job. It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out. Also, the government did a job on private foundations, making it more difficult for them to act to support research. The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding, and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money. Suppose, as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months. What do you think happens if I ask for one? The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\" Now the money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported. So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects get supported, and how much. Also, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread. So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being. And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals. As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research. What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult. In addition, tomorrow I may get unexpected research results. Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop. This is the nature of the beast, and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring more than minimal attention of a good researcher. I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.",

    "text": "LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists CLAIM to be looking for a \"Unified Field Theory\" in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations. But they have been systematically IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time: (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational- rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL DATUM\"). At each step in the development, Larson was able to MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY BURSTS). And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter- atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of matter. All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy complex mathematics, in his books. BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson The following is a complete list of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe. Some of the early books are out of print now, but still available through inter-library loan. \"The Structure of the Physical Universe\" (1959) \"The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom\" (1963) \"Beyond Newton\" (1964) \"New Light on Space and Time\" (1965) \"Quasars and Pulsars\" (1971) \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979) [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION \"Super Collider\".] [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.] \"The Neglected Facts of Science\" (1982) \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" (1984) [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical mysteries.] \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988) All but the last of these books were published by North Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR 97213, and should be available via inter-library loan if your local university or public library doesn't have each of them. Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS), 1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah 84106. This is the organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory. They have other related publications, including the quarterly journal \"RECIPROCITY\". Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer (Chemical or Electrical). He was about 91 years old when he died in May 1989. He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University. He developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE chemical properties based only on the elements used. Larson's lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is NOT A VALID REASON. Sometimes it takes a relative outsider to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES. At the same time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally test his Theory. And it was NOT necessary for him to do so. He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER researchers' experimental and observational data. And in many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX physicists and astronomers have! They CLAIM to be looking for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe so well. Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree. And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPT",

If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh ultimately kept his total costs below that amount. But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to realize that much more was at stake than $25,000.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center. Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news frequently. WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF? The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov). The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102, \"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target in second stage.\" This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try to interpret. 1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling. 2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the \"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly negative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\"). This causes a little bit of \"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z direction) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\" We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the most \"delicate\" part of the vehicle. 3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn't roll (\"performance gain\"). 4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver complexity\"). 5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio antennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\"). 6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine. 7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east (usually). This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit. Remember: velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit. This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with? Why does the Shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude?\" The answer is that the pads were leftovers from the Apollo days. The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust. (You can see the effects of this on any daytime launch. The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is fluffy white steam. Watch for the difference between the \"top\" [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's. (A side note: the Saturn V's also had a roll program. Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle guy.) I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \"roll maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw. The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated. The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance. The yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination. The total maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element array.

In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team. Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a \"standby\" mode for use in an emergency. In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap. Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark. I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time. In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money), but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.",

A NASA friend and I spent one drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization on the face of the Moon. Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning. Hmmm. It actually isn't all that much, is it? Like about 2 million km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2 per burger that said organization sold last year). You'd be best off with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft). If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon. You might have to abandon the colour, though. Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's your uncle. I'll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of identity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010. Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink vendors? Who else might be interested? Would they buy it, given that it's a _lot_ more expensive, and not much more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km inflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO, visible 24 hours from your key growth market). I'll do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of identity).",

    "text": "_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to \"conventional\" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at least it was a good try... So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances? Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow. We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models. A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service. To get a copy of this paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject line get 9304001 Here is the abstract of that paper. The currently favored explanation for the origin of \\GRBs puts them at cosmological distances; but as long as there is no distance indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list, although there is no known mechanism for generating \\GRBs from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \\GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved. We use the available data on the distribution of \\GRBs (the BATSE catalogue up to March, 1992), and the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams (1992) to investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of \\GRBs and comets' aphelia, assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect, at least to some extent, true variations in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\\vov$ test to both distributions.",

Please inquire to the phone number and address listed. --------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier\" Sponsored by the Planetary Studies Foundation The Planetary Studies Foundation is sponsoring a one week class for teachers called \"Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier.\" The class will be held at the Sheraton Suites in Elk Grove, Illinois from June 14 through June 18. Participants who complete the program can earn two semester hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers. The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool to get students excited about learning and interested in science. Classroom topics to be covered by the class include: > Living in Space > The Space Shuttle > The Space Station > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics > The Solar System There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and the Museum of Science and Industry. Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by the Planetary Studies Foundation. The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9 which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June 17. The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials, continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest tickets for the dinner banquet are also available. There is an additional charge to receive the two hours of graduate credit. For any additional information about the class, contact the Science Learning Center at (708) 359-7913.

    "text": "Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept. It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a \"pusher plate\" attached to the main spacecraft. The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship. Now, in an atmosphere I can see this. The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate. But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products). Would this work? I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there. I must be missing something. Would someone enlighten me via email? Thanks. -- --Jim",

    "text": "Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my question about which countries engage in space surveillance. Unfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance, rather than space surveillance What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of) satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance). The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so. The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing. Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available. See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov. The material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be that other countries do also. Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do it, and why do they do it? Allen Thomson SAIC McLean, VA",

Rather, the argument was that if life arose shortly the last sterilizing event, then it must be easily formed. The *inference* was that life originated before and was destroyed, but there was no evidence of that. However, even this argument is flawed. It could well be that origin of life requires specific conditions (say, a certain composition of the atmosphere) that do not last for long. So, perhaps life formed early only because it would have had no other chance to do so, not because it was likely that life would originate under those conditions.",

    "text": "A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were visible till morning sunrise. The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller. A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky. The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969 we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we have observed 17 satellite launches. Leo Wikholm",

They're basically happy with their government business and don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially. A secondary problem is that it is a bit big. They'd need to go after multi-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketing task quite significantly. They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time to get them started properly. If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had prevented launches from it for a year or so. There have been a few CT launches. Mars Observer was one of them. So was that stranded Intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reached orbit properly.",

April 6, 1993 RELEASE: 93-64 Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station. A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds. Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget. For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years. Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider. Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process. To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal. Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\" NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.",

It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages. It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from what you'd need for the brute-force approach.",

If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know! Also, if there's an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure it out, I'll add it to the list. Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic. If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space! :-) The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days. All comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu. Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your own for figuring out what they *mean*! Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply different ways of referring to the same thing. Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately). Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs. Special Bonus! At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion. Thanks, Larry!

Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound? What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter. The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh. Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks. It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge. The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid. Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people. If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today. Instead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+. Incompetent law enforcement can kill you!",

    "text": "Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025). 1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill? What is the status of these bills? I've heard they're \"in committee\". How close is that to being made law? 2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar. Are there any important differences I missed? 3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes: A. S414 doesn't specify an \"appeals\" process to wrongful denial during the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?) (S414 has an appeals process once the required instant background check system is established, but not before). B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving using existing records (so who would I sue in \"A\" above to have an inaccurate record corrected?) C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member. But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a \"threat\", nor does it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception statement. True? Have I misunderstood? Any other 'holes? 4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a \"clean\" record from buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks? At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this? 'Seems at min. a \"gun counting\" scheme would be needed (e.g., \"John Doe owns N guns\"). So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work. Please comment. I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.",

    "text": "Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations: 1. This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim translation\" of a Nazi law. What it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section. The implication is that the similarities are devastating. In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation. Not surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a single idea: that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, urban-folklore style. 2. The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution team or later. This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't understand why. The author repeats several times that he is simply unable to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly: \"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German law registry].\" Bingo. Exactly. Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion. All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman have a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author's admission. He then continues: \"But if he acquired the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so for a very specific reason...\" But there's absolutely no reason to think that this is the case. In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy. All arguments about whether the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red herrings. 3. Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he asked to have it translated. The problem is, in the context of the charge levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other. People ask to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*. If Dodd took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, wouldn't he? Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly. Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this purpose? Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties, needed a crib sheet? Didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own? Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the Nazi law.\" In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning the history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd's motivation isn't a mystery: he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR. 4. Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law. Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT a \"Nazi-inspired\" idea. The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the 1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification of certain weapons as sporting weapons. The JPFO then goes on to list other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews; of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA. Nevertheless, in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\" -- so as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.",

    "text": "This is where Freeman's love of accuracy becomes really ridiculous. [his point was that it is possible under certain circumstances for many people to carry concealed in Illinois] I did read the law before I commented on it. Judging from replies I received about my \"Semantics on t.p.g\" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g assume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one. It would also follow that said person would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or business. Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant. The thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere. I'm sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home. Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I am not taking into account city ordinances). I could care less about whether or not I can carry concealed at home. I only care about the fact that I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street. Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense. I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore. The only thing that is happening now is that Freeman and I are \"running around in circles\" trying to prove each other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore. Of course now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier posts but what can I do. My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some- times.",

    "text": "Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the _Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television station, KTVB Channel 7. Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4. Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial. Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen. Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied. The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence. Although Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper. Cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan. Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court. Cooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\" Cooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!] Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog. When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down. Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \"If you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong, counselor.\" Spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver's dog. Cooper disagreed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time. Howen also complained that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events. U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys. \"I'm not going to play games with either counsel. This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start acting like professionals.\" Spence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we'll see that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" Spence continued, \"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\" Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can't have a fair trial if the jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm violating court orders.\" Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and denied the motion for a mistrial. Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting. The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton. The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility. Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned Rampton about the dog. Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected. Matthews then had Rampton read a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them. Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that, but he could not remember when. He then stated that, \"I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted.\"",

It is because of (1) attitude and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the good neighbors step up and say \"THAT'S the one officer ! He was robbing Mr. Jones' house\".

    "text": "I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from government sources except two. As far as I am concerned, I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise. The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given NATIONAL exposure. Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally, in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all. And even then, they cleverly cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded \"national exposure,\" but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it. The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript. We'll never know if he would have kept that one. Strangely enough, the previous day they said they were prepared to \"wait as long as it takes.\" Quite possible. But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing line between guilt and innocence -- only the line between murder and negligent manslaughter. This would be an interesting development. It's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to \"go state's evidence,\" parrot the FBI story, hang the whole \"suicide\" on Koresh, claim they only stayed at gunpoint, etc. If any of them do this in the next few weeks, it doesn't prove much; but if none of them do, it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is dead wrong. --",

Two years ago this month my house and office burned. In my office was my reloading bench. On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was about 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20 and .308. The fire was extinguished before the area containing the reloading supplies were fully involved. There was about 1/2\" of char on the joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting. Lots of heat in other words. None of the powder kegs ignited. One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited. No explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do. The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids completely melted and ran down inside. The smokless powder was contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs. The kegs were charred badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case of the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away. Many of the rounds cooked off. They were in close proximity to wood on all sides so the effects were easy to observe. In most cases with the rifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle. Many bullets were found still in the neck. Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into the wood. Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually dislodge them. Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets. The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around. No dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bullets left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard. Ordinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless of what the FBI says. John",

I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g. 1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get a concealed carry permit in Canada. This is contrary to what I was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me. Guns must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will be exempt or how this will be managed. This is up to each province. The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines. Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these 'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess. Dealers will be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will not be considered prohibited weapons. Amendments to the regulations specify some possible methods to alter the magazines. Some manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines. (God knows how much they'll charge for these) This covers most of what we discussed. I have typed this from memory, do not take it as gospel. I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "text": "I don't think such a Canada is any more \"culturally similar\" to the United States than England. In terms of laws regarding individual rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ greatly from those of the United States. Actually, they do not have \"roughly the same... urban economy\", and extremely different ethnic composition. However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences, the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class. The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle, while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver. The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not one of gun control. That is a gross distortion: \"Self-defense\" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.) So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.",

This is nothing more than Feisal Husseini's statement that the Zionist entity must be disolved by forcing it to \"engage\" the surrounding \"normal\" Arab society. \"a strong mixed stock\", \"integration of Israeli society into the Middle East in a graceful manner,\" these are the phrases of Nazi racial engineering pure and simple. As if Israeli society has no right to exist per se! \"the continued existance of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.\" Disolve the Jewish People and protect human values such as love and peace; yes ve have heard this before Her Himmler.

There are remarkable similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre: 69 year old Hatin Nine telling: -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu: - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours. Turks, you must die.'' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin: - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes.'' Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off. Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \"lies.\" They are saying \"exaggeration.\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.'' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human rights violations. International reactions must be made with international cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals, journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of \"human rights?\" Where are you? Serdar Argic",

    "text": "CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the massacres there including Deir Yassen, though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are greatly minimized. As per request of Hasan: From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977: [pp. 225-227] \"Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill. By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties. \"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2]. \"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.' \"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa.\" [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \"To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\"",

Did you think that you could cover up the genocide perpetrated by your fascist grandparents against my grandparents in 1914? You've never heard of 'April 23rd'? \"In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul. It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us create for ourselves. It certainly is possible to severe the artificial life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats in this alien land.\" (Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - \"Preserving the Armenian purity\") During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland. The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

    "text": "Dear friends, I am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee. As part of the requirements for a research class in music education I designed a questionnaire to colect data for my research project. The study intends to determine which techniques (if any) have been used to teach music for the deaf. If you have any experience in music education for the deaf and would like to help me with this project, your help would be very much appreciated. If you also want to exchange some ideas about the subject matter, feel yourself welcome. I have been working in this area for a while (in Brazil _ by the way, I am Brazilian _ and also in US) and I am very pleased with the results. I hope that this inquiry will not cause too many inconveniences. Thank you for or time and consideration. __QUESTIONNAIRE__ Teaching Music for deaf children.

It seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon. If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then Israel would not have to be there. Until it is, Israel prefers that its soldiers die rather than its children. Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is signed. Not a day before. Withdraw because of casualties would tell the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is kill a few soldiers. Its not gonna happen. Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer zone? It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while holding your neighbors land. If Lebanon were willing to agree to those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.

    "text": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Unconventional peace proposal A unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East. ---------------------------------------------------------- by Elias Davidsson The following proposal is based on the following assumptions: 1. Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states. 2. In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail. 3. Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists. 4. This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations. 5. Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties. 6. Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed. 7. As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible. 8. Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share. Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal. 1. A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab. 2. To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return. 3. For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child. 4. The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S. and a great number of governments and international organizations. 5. The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner. Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these: 1. The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation. 2. It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above) 3. Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights. The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above) 4. It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject funda",

If a Human Rights Czar is appointed at the U.N., we could have international monitors recording events and responses of local officials and develop an objective basis. This could be backed by adjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcement through a Rapid Deployment Force under the U.N. Secretary General's command. I would like to see the U.N. directly impose ICJ rulings whenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the UN Security Council.. much as the President can't veto a U.S. Supreme Court ruling). The U.S. is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar -- the third world opposition is led by three countries, China, Iran and Pakistan (What company is Pakistan keeping!). The U.S. is also reconsidering its opposition to the U.N. force initially envisaged in the Charter (although under the control of the Security Council). The UN SC is quite a flawed body. Rogue governments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the last few months to block the move to place U.N. troops in Bosnia under Chapter 7 instead of 11 (if I have the numbers straight) where they could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force without requiring further SC action.

    "text": "At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy. This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed. It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on. Read this: From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992 PUBLICATION BAN The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. By Baruch Me'iri All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \"Look, the subject is too delicate. If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\". The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment. In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it. Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy. In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \"the third man\" being in prison. But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries. But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993. The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor. Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter: \"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses. In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment. In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\", asserts MK Zucker. On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials. But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public. \"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel. The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\" Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question. \"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment. The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\", wrote Zucker. The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public. This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy. Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\". \"The Union is aware\", says Shiffman, \"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld. I am speaking only of several days. I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest. That is done because of the great secrecy. \"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court. But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity. The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\" Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possi",

    "text": "Yarn of Cargo of Human Bones [1] Copyright, 1924, by the New York Times Company Special Cable to The New York Times PARIS, Dec 22, -- Marseilles is excited by a weird story of the arrival in that port of a ship flying the British flag and named Zan carrying a mysterious cargo of 400 tons of human bones consigned to manufacturers there. The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated. - - - Reference - - - [1] _New York Times_, December 23, 1924, page 3, column 2 (bottom) - - - - - - - - - - - - On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice. In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the successful genocide of the Armenians. Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet... Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as \"rebels\". Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland. Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims Armenians were a \"threat\". In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe. Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish population. The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide. ARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR",

    "text": "Are you related to 'Arromdian' of ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle? Ditto. HELSINKI WATCH: \"PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE\" Ankara (A.A) In a 15-page report of the \"Helsinki Watch\" it is stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end. The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant social and political rights to all the members of minorities that are equal to those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition they must recognize the existence of the \"Turkish Minority\" in Western Thrace and grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'. NEWSPOT, May 1992 GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS The Xanthi independent MP Ahmet Faikoglu said that the Greek state is trying to cut all contacts and relations of the Turkish minority with Turkey. Pointing out that while the Greek minority living in Istanbul is called \"Greek\" by ethnic definition, only the religion of the minority in Western Thrace is considered. In an interview with Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish.\" Emphasizing the education problem for the Turkish minority in Western Thrace Faikoglu said that according to an agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace. Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr. SadIk Ahmet to defend the rights of the Turkish minority, Faikoglu said. \"In fact we helped Greece. Because we prevented Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek government to recognize our legal rights.\" On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed out that both countries are predestined to live in peace for geographical and historical reasons and said that Turkey and Greece must resist the foreign powers who are trying to create a rift between them by cooperating, adding that in Turkey he observed that there was will to improve relations with Greece. NEWSPOT, January 1993 MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE. Two ethnic Macedonian human rights activists will face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS. Hristos Sideropoulos and Tashko Bulev (or Anastasios Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine. Sideropoulos and Bulev gave an interview to the Greek weekly magazine \"ENA\" on March 11, 1992, and said that they as Macedonians were denied basic human rights in Greece and would field an ethnic Macedonian candidate for the up-coming Greek general election. Bulev said in the interview: \"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\" Sideropoulos said in the article that \"Greece should recognise Macedonia. The allegations regarding territorial aspirations against Greece are tales... We are in a panic to secure the border, at a time when the borders and barriers within the EEC are falling.\" The main charge against the two, according to the court summons, was that \"they have spread...intentionally false information which might create unrest and fear among the citizens, and might affect the public security or harm the international interests of the country (Greece).\" The Greek state does not recognise the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000 ethnic Macedonians living within Greece, largely concentrated in the north. It is a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian. In 1913 Greece, Serbia-Yugoslavia and Bulgaria partioned Macedonia into three pieces. In 1919 Albania took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991 as the independent Republic of Macedonia. There are 1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper. Sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for Macedonian human rights in Greece, and lost his job as a forestry worker a few years ago. He was even exiled to an obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government to allow him to return to his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live. Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos affair as a show trial in which Greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent, especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia. Last year the State Department of the United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government will do anything until the Presidential elections are over. Serdar Argic",

I do not know why, but if, let's say, the Palestineans (some of them) want ALL ISRAEL, and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis. Or, maybe they (palestinenans) are not yet ready for statehood ? Or, maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership, too many fractions aso ? I am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one, but any of these could make arabs stall the negotiations. I like California oranges. And the feelings may get sharper at the table.

Between the Awali river and the \"Security Zone\" only Lebanese troops are stationed. That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government. I agree peace guarantees would be better for all, but I am addressing the problem as it stands now. Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for both sides. My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period. In my opinion, if Israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than staying. The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a move. I hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs, that's why I post to tpm. As I explained, I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally I believe no attacks would ensue against northern Israel. I also explained why I believe that to be the case. My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides. It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion. That is too bad. Because Israel is not occupying the \"Security Zone\" free of charge. It is paying the price for that. Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives, that is my contention. If Lebanon were willing to agree to That is completely untrue. Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese politics. The real heavy weights are Syria's allies. The gov't is supported by Syria. The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and unified like never before. Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal. That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts. If Israel does withdraw and such an act (Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral suicide. Basil",

    "text": "A typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event could have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case to occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis, or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she? An Appeal to Mankind During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated. The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace. The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded. Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations. One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States. One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan. It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR. We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade. But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands. The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent. But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes? All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

    "text": "Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what really happened. There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek Men's Lycee Foundation. As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court. In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.' It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy. The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward Hellenizing the region. And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in 24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice and remains without a job. Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their findings were published in a report titled 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.' The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a",

The henrik] KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are henrik] the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. Agression that has NO MERCY henrik] for INOCENT people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG-23's and henrik] othe Russian aircraft. henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL henrik] NEVER OCCUR again. DA] Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan. It is Armenian DA] soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan. Well, this is your opinion ! Turkish/ Azeris can BARK all they WANT since the ABOVE is UNTRUE. However, I am sure YOU GUYS would have NEVER brought up ARMENIA's involvement if KARABAKHI-Armenians had had HEAVY losses. DA] You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression DA] only in that region. It seems to me that the Armenians are better DA] organized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns DA] repeatedly. Read what ? The New York Times , that is publishing anti-armenian articles. Nop, I have my resources. Look, everyone knows how aggressive Turks/Azeris have been in the past. Armenians ARE NOT gona sit around and watch FIRE WORKS by AZERIS taught by TURKS. DA] It seems to me that the Armenians are better organized, have more success DA] militarily and shell Azeri towns repeatedly. Buch of non-sence CRAP and you know it. Who the hell you think you are talking to ? Azeris are FIGHTING LOCAL ARMENIANS in Nagarno-Karabakh. You tell me who has more MIG's ? Freedom fighters in Nagarno-Karabakh or Azerbaijan ? Again, I will say it for the last time, ARMENIA is NOT involved in this WAR and you guys WANT to bring this up in order to cover up the Turkish involvment in the Karabakh. Go ahead , REPEAT as much as you want. DA] I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion. Turkey had the right to DA] intervene, and it did. Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to DA] last for so long, but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both DA] on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed DA] for the ongoing standoff in the region. Not a chance ! You CAN NOT convince me (based on your REASONS)that your GOVERNMENT did the RIGHT thing to invade CYPRUS. DA] Lastly, why is there not a soc.culture.armenia? I vote yes for it. DA] After all, it is now free.",

We had many of the same prophets, but Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who Christians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed. The idea of believing in one God should unite all peoples. However, note that Christianity and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each religion. We are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are paid. Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are poor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims around the world). Also, this money is not required in the human sense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid (and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer services)). God's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere, God may show signs of existence in other places as well. We can not say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where he has not/. The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah. Muslims believe that the Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same message, thus the many similiarities. However, the Taurah and the Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed their meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator(s). The Qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in - Arabic. Therefore, we know that mankind has not changed its meaning. It is truly what was revealed to Mohammed at that time. There are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb. Only God knows for sure how it will turn out. I hope it won't, but if that happens, it was the will of God. Please send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what you said. And yes, may God help us all.",

The governments of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly. However, proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants. Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic. Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere. You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less.",

    "text": "They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below. Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads. The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities. Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard. Source: Documents: Volume I (1919). \"Document No: 76,\" Archive No: 1/2, Cabin No: 109, Drawer No: 3, File No: 346, Section No: 427(1385), Contents No: 3, 52-53. (To Lt. Colonel Seyfi, General Headquarters, Second Section, Istanbul - Dr. Stephan Eshnanie) 'Neues Wiener Tagblatt' - Vienna, 'Pester Lloyd' 'Local Anzliger' - Berlin, 'Algemeen Handelsblat' - Amsterdam, 'Vakit' - Istanbul. \"I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.

I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a \"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-) Response: This makes much sense to me. This is also true of most religions. There is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people who call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually *BEING* any of these. The social groups tend to make very important requirements about not belonging to other 'religions'. I find that the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that 'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'Perennial Philosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :> Tony: I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I looked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\". Response: Certainly true. I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves 'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC. Sure, I've heard all the hubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these Western esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'. I'll admit my bias. I live in San Jose. :> Tony: \"You'll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. Response: This may be slightly off. I've met some of these Rosicrucians and have a couple friends in AMORC. The stories I've heard and the slight contact I've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received with any kind of warm welcome. I still like to think that most people who are involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.) are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'. Tony: It is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non- sectarian*. Response: I'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call themselves 'Rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'. Is this 'nonsectarian' like the Masons, who require that a member 'believe in God by his/her definition'? Tony: I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with \"us containing something divine\"... And yes I don't like phrases like \"eternal bliss\" either! :-) Response: Let alone us *BEING* something divine. ;> Tony: BTW, I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you free of charge. Response: Addresses, phone numbers of groups? I'm into networking. Thanks.",

In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use. The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better. It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man. This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done). Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result. David. --- On religion:",

Jesus makes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners. Psychology, the id, ego, superego by Freud? Elements of truth, but Jesus explained it far better and gave reasons. Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men. They can screw up the Bible just as well as any man. I do not put these men on a pedestal. And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly, he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met. Here's some more circular reasoning to you. Paul says to the Corinthians that \"that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is spiritually discerned.\" And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a clue to what the Bible is saying. From your point of view, that's incredibly circular and convenient. To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally bizarre. I can see it, but you can't. This is not arrogance on my part. Trust me. It is as bizarre to you as it is to me. But nonetheless, it is a truth, explainable or not. Are any of you color blind to red and green? I am. Remember those dot tests they do at the optomologist's? They put pictures in front of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots? If your eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals embedded in the dots. They are a slightly different color and stand out from the background. But if you are color blind to red and green, you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots. That is how a dot test appears to me. I do not see a pattern at all. A normal seeing person will see the patterns. And to him, I seem like a total anomaly. To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something. It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything that to him is as plain as day. That it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer. The believer can see the meaning in the words. I can see how the patterns fit together. There is such depth. Such consistency. But then, on the other hand, I notice the non-believer. He doesn't see it. He thinks I am weird because he thinks I am seeing things. I look at him, and say, \"No, you are weird. You do not see.\" Then it is time for a sanity check. I go to another Christian and say, \"Do you see this.\" And they go, \"Yes. It is an \"X\"\". And I say, \"Thank God, I see the \"X\" too.\" It is truly the strangest thing. It adds a little extra dimension to the phrase, \"He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.\"",

In this case, the definition of the word \"create\" is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed. I should have said \"given the Mormon belief.\" If you disagree with the Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important point. Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by such terms. It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe. Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or organized or whatever) by Him. We also believe that being \"offspring\" of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \"born again\" of Him. Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings. This is how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous. <...> On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says. You say that one must simply \"look at the Bible\" to see what it teaches, but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says. Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the scriptures? Let me clarify this one more time. You did not refer to the Mormon belief that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same. We keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below) On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance. The fact is that they are not. Whether or not they indicate general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large number of Mormons.",

    "text": "THE DIVINE MASTERS Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God into the physical world, God Incarnate. But there are some very important related facts that Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of most other world religions. First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH- STANDING. There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and after the life of Jesus. The followers of some of these Masters founded the world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of their Master in the process. Christians, for example, added THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the teaching of REincarnation. Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY alive. (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE UNIVERSES.) Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly MANUFACTURED by the Romans. And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING indicator for religious validity. These things are similarly true for followers of most other major world religions, including Islam. Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \"silver cord\". True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five levels or universes above the physical universe, and this canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine Master. One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, (P.O. Box 27300; zip 55427). Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant Mat\" organization. One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA 90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in most public and university libraries and some book stores, or obtained thru inter-library loan. The book \"ECKANKAR--THE KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER classic. Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world dictator during the so-called \"last days\". But the Masters don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as Jesus was. People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine Master. RE-INCARNATION The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi- ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel- ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read- ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED BEFORE?!). [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\". Later versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES. For example, a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE. And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to another person being met for the first time in THIS life, becaus",

But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist. Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science. This is in contrast to your Objective Morality. There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality. But there exists no objective morality. Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of the physical world around us. In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ). Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe. It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

    "text": "Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though. As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud). The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate). The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created in His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. Revelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse. This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness. No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\" to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own. David. --- On religion:",

    "text": "Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade MAGI: [Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).] The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain etymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly tribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of the six tribes of the Medes. For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi. The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis. There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from the root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis (Gershevitch, 1964). The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of high priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue on",

As for not knocking, it's a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight. Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so commonly, now would it? Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my point, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear judgement on this issue. I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day. Furthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects. Do you suggest that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers's badges? Just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects? How far can they reasonably go to identiy themselves? What do you suggest they can do which can't be faked by the \"competition\"? Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not an excuse to murder police. In the case of the BD's, there was almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops.",

O.K. DB... [By the way Mr DeCenso, you really should have looked in the index of your Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich Greek lexicon. You would have found that the word in Acts for \"lot\" is \"kleros,\" not \"CHORION\" as stated by Mr Archer, and nowhere in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to \"Theological Dictionary of the New Testament\" by Bromley, is the meaning \"burial plot\" discussed. It discusses the forms of \"kleros\" (eg: kleros, kleroo, etc), and the various meanings of \"kleros\" (eg: \"plot of land,\" and \"inheritance\"), but mentions nothing about CHORION or \"burial plot.\" (Why does this not surprise me?)

It is my habit to check my articles before and after their submission for errors. In my last article I stated: I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus confused \"kleros\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of land discussed. In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts 1:18. Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I cannot report as to the nuances of the word. I don't know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure that someone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating mistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point\" _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY... Vary noble of you Dave. I didn't want to have to go to x number of sources to show you wrong. (Although I am researching CHORION a little).

And Bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when I accused Mr DeCenso of actually believing Bullinger, he replied that I misquoted him: of > my response to see what I REALLY said in my posting of this article. [Actually Mr DeCenso, you said that there was \"benefit\" to our argument, in that it caused to to rediscover Bullinger's exegisis. I did not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial, unless you were convinced by it].\" MY REPLY... Thank you for correcting your restating of my points. DB... \"and Mr DeCenso also replied: Thus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such \"drek\" convincing....he should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of \"This is what Bullinger believed, not necessarily what I believe.\" So which is it Mr DeCenso? Do you find the exegisis convincing or not?)\" MY REPLY... One of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various Bible scholars and students alike. When I present MY VIEWS, I will clearly distinguish them from now on. DB... \"Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented no Greek exegisis at all, and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual Greek. Thus we find this demand on his part for quality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.\" MY REPLY... Good point. But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug deeper. I'm glad you have begun in this post. I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well. DB... \"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence. Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it often enough: But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole. Let's see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages, we see that he has also used (b). On the other hand he has presented no use of: (d) historical context or (e) historical content or (f) other pertinent historical info or (g) cultural context or (h) cultural content or (i) other pertinent cultural info or (j) grammatical construction or even (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count] Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\" MY ",

Whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with whether we do evil things. We do them regardless. Jesus uses the word \"men\". I am included. Jesus is not soloing you out. Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man. Christians are not immuned from doing evil things. A Christian is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells. A Christian can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought out into the light. Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been exposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil. If you haven't seen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been exposed to the His light. You may shed some light on your own. Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela. But the Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela. The Holy Spirit can shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know existed. So do you see Jesus's point? Christians are not perfect. Nonchristians are not perfect. Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives, and they will not like the sight.

It is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was their downfall to death. And Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him. David Koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ. David Koresh, who claimed to be Jesus, was a fraud. It was obvious. David Koresh was born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem. Koresh wasn't even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that. Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times. David Koresh wasn't anything new to Jesus. Jesus told us to be aware of imposters 2000 years ago. So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be Jesus. Ask the obvious. Where were you born? Was your mother's name Mary? If the Branch Davidians asked that simple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar right from the start. The wouldn't have followed Koresh. They wouldn't have died. But look what happened. Their ignorance cost them their lives. Their choice to be ignorant cost them a lot. Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus? Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context? Do you remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt Eve? Did he not misquote God? What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, was the same ploy he tried on Jesus. But in Jesus's case, Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context. It didn't work with Jesus. Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what Koresh did to his followers? Who did Koresh emulate? Who was Koresh's teacher? Koresh did to his followers what Satan did to Eve. Did not Koresh kill his followersr? Did not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well? Did not the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew the real Christ was born in Bethlehem? Did not Eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death? God held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller. None of them had an excuse.",

    "text": "The primary problem in human nature is a \"fragmentation of being.\" Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind. The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures. Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St. Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\" One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering. This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state. The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed. Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot? God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God. Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies. The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.",

You refer to # differing interpretations of \"create,\" and say that many Christians may # not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith # on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is # truth, regardless of popularity of opinions. It may be \"irrelevant\" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say \"bias\"?), but it is relevant to me and many others. You're right, \"the bottom line IS truth,\" independant from you or anyone else. Since you proclaim \"truths\" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what authority you do this? Because \"it says so in the Bible?\" --Does the Bible \"say so,\" or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or \"disapproval\"? Excuse moi, but your line of \"truths\" haven't moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous. Of all the \"preachers\" of \"truth\" on this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking crew, with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint... BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus to the pharisees: \"ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips, but your hearts are far removed from me...\" # Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created # and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \"granted the Mormon # belief...\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to # have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address # and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the # conclusion that you grant. Sophistry. Look who's talking: \"jumping to conclusions?\" You wouldn't do that yourself, right? All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever. # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created. The Bible states that Jesus # is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS # belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same. A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine. The former KGB would have loved to employ you. Jesus and lucifer are not \"the same,\" silly, and you know it. (...) # The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is # nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible # says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God: Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says. The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they \"belong to\" or follow God in His footsteps. Satan and his followers have rebelled against God, and are not \"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\" but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation. # # The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the # kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \"one\"; # (Matthew 13:38) kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus (and have shown \"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.

A much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way. (Although that's not the historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens. So it's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me? Of course not.) Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel. The use of anti-Sun to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented, but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now. -- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)",

    "text": "In <1993Apr24.214843.10940@midway.uchicago.edu> eeb1@quads.uchicago.edu I already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause me to make another, independent reply. The problem with a \"moment of silence\" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of \"allowing\" for religion amongst students in the public schools. As I noted before, Muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are required by Muhammad to do. And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this. There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this \"moment of silence\" shit. And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special times and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer being able taking note of it.) A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others. That may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant \"mainstream\" religion. All that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which doesn't NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools. There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs, or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world. A Christian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during the day, without anyone else knowing it. [That may also be true of non- Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise]. In the \"moment of silence\" it would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed forms. But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore, the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that. Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as a Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools), and a growing Muslim presence as well. I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians. As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of silence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity. And as a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion. For what it's worth, I suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians -- it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in \"making\" their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach what THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so. If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of silence in school. If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment will only embarrass you. Give it up.",

I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single such evidence from the history of Islam!

We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire. In the absense of any more evidence, I don't see how we can decide who to believe. Furthermore, its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else. With the state of the area now, we may never know what happened. Again, we have only the word of the FBI on this claim. The lawyers who have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim. I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities. Its more likely that the BD's started the fire than did the FBI. But there is currently NO way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence (which is nearly none). D. The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs. I am truely amazed that I have heard (or read) of no one suggesting this possibility. With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside. I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over. With the winds, it would have quickly gotten out of control. No, I think that D is also quite reasonable. I personally can't really asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI or BD) over intential setting of the fire). I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds. The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that they've reach any such conclusions. He pointed out that under intense heat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard. In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on Monday. We should remain skeptical until more information is available. --",

They may say they are \"Christian\" but do their actions speak differently? Do you believe what everyone tells you? I don't. I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions. And ultimately by my own choice. Salvation, however, was granted only through the grace of God. To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the very name Christian. If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in your heart, what does that say of your belief? White supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian. \"If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot see?\" What does this belief entail? Believing in Christ and having your sins forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin. To repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it again. I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me of being such, then are you not pre-judging me? BTW, I am of Chinese racial background and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this country. I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these White supremist \"Christians\" as you call them. Anyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach, then their belief is false. Do you concur? Nazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention. What I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial intolerance and bigotry. They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them. No arguement there. The only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian may not be Christian. I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they do and what they say. If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus Christ then they are NOT Christian. If they have not repented of their sins and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are NOT Christian. These are the only criteria to being a Christian.

Because when seeing the word \"hell\" many readers impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English! In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of \"shadowy realm.\" Hades is simply the abode we call the grave. All dead go to this hell. The second \"hell\" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in scripture, 2 Pet.2:4; \"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment...\" Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; Rev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels (now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18). They were cast down to Tartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3). Tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or demons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans). Nowhere in the Bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular \"hell\". The the third word that is translated as \"hell\" in the Bible is Gehenna. It comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning \"valley of Hinniom.\" Hinnom is a deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem. In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including infant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made their children \"pass through the fire\" to the god Molech. The rites were specifically celebrated in Tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief groves in the valley). King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations. He defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10). Later the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for sewage, refuse and animal carcasses. The bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish. Fires burned continuously, feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse. Aceldama, the \"field of blood\", purchased with the money Judas received for the betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom. So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell? In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working religious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming. Their fate is revealed by the apostle John: \"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet... These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.\" Where will this temporary lake of fire (this \"hell\") be? The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: \"For Tophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it\" (Isa.30:33). One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10). But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia? Does the Bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire? In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will become of these wicked? Will they writhe in flames for eternity? The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna fire on the earth. They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed! This punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final). The Bible calls it the \"second death\" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a further resurrection. The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing. The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. \"For, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all th",

By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may. This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists. They find what they want to find. They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others). Why an insert? Read it - I have, a number of times. The passage is glaringly out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere in his work. The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which it lies. It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears. Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated here. What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\" nothing. Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\" Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim. Until forthcoming, your belief is based on faith. That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact. As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions. Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate? I suggest you read _Gospel Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry). The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny your position. On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already discussed, and so far you have not provided any). Until then, its faith. Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic. You have attempted to \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove. Its no different than saying \"I am right because I say so.\" Your logic is full of circles. It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly. The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where \"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1) Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God. Presbyterians construe \"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant. Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to contain the first four. Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was! Its faith, Bill. You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. Whatever works for you. Just don't foist it on others.

You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless. Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \"worth\" is subjective. When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective: objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon. By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase \"objective worth\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus \"objective\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is \"good\") is subjective. I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality.",
